# SEA INFO-6150 Final Project

We work for a small business named **Vehiclr** that offers certain kinds of vehicles that can be bought online and personalized with a number of options.

Our team has been tasked with designing, building and testing a new website for **Vehiclr**.

I have already implemented a number of pieces of the website that relate to state management, routing, injecting data into the UI, etc.

Your role is to coordinate with the other members of your team to build the UI pieces and CSS stylesheets that display the data in a usable, accessible and attractive way.

You are encouraged to do research and look at other websites that sell products to get ideas about how to present the **Vehiclr** products and order flow.

The website will be presented to the rest of the class on **Wednesday, April 17, 2019**.

## Rubric
This project is worth 30% of your final grade.

### Final website
15% of your final grade will be the total score of the website produced based on the rubric below. The same score will be awarded identically among all team members.

Projects will be evaluated on a 0-100 scale for each of 5 sections. Each section score will be multiplied by .20 and the 5 sections will be added together to calculate the final 0-100 score.

### Journal/writeup
15% of your final grade will be your individual score as determined by the level of effort/participation detailed in your project journal/writeup. You should keep this journal while your team is working on the project as a record of your individual participation.

## Project Requirements

### HTML
The HTML for your website must be semantically correct and valid to the best of your ability. I will be validating the site with the W3 HTML Validator (http://validator.w3.org).

### Products
**Vehiclr** offers certain kinds of vehicles that can be bought online and personalized with a number of options. The current product offerings can be viewed in `src/data/products.json`

There are already some product-related components built for you to use in your project:
* AllProducts -- display all products available
* CategoryProducts -- display products available for the categoryId in the route
* ProductDetail -- display a single product based on the categoryId and productId in the route

### AllProducts and CategoryProducts page
These pages **must** use grid or flex to display the products available.

### ProductDetail page
You must display the following pieces of data:
* large ("lg") category image (from `src/data/categories.json`) -- this is already implemented but needs styling
* ID number
* year
* price
* sale price (if available, see below)
* title
* description

This page sends the user into the first step of the order flow via an `Order` button that has already been implemented for you.

### Sale products
Some products may be on sale. This is indicated with a `sale: [some number]` value being present in the `src/data/products.json` object. If the product is on sale, you should style the product so that it's clear to the user that it is on sale and displays both the original and sale prices.

### Unavailable products
Some products may not be available. This is indicated with a `available: false` value being present in the `src/data/products.json` object. If the product is not available, we still want to show it on the AllProducts, CategoryProducts and ProductDetail pages; however, you should style the product so that it's clear to the user that it is not available and make it so that you cannot click on the `Order` button on the product detail page.

### Categories
Each product belongs to a category (given by the product's categoryId).

There is already a category-related component built for you to use in your project:
Categories -- display a list of categories that link to the page where CategoryProducts are displayed.

Every product in a category will use the category image for its display image instead of an individual image.

### Routes
All of the pages of the site are available via components controlled by a router. This simplifies the process of linking the pages together and gives a straightforward mapping of which component is associated with which URL of the website.

There is already a router implemented with the following routes in place -- **not all of these routes have components built yet**.

#### `/`
corresponds to `http://localhost:3000/` and the Home component; the homepage of the website.

#### `/products`
corresponds to `http://localhost:3000/products` and the AllProducts component; the full product listing.

#### `/products/:category`
corresponds to a route like `http://localhost:3000/products/sedan` and the CategoryProducts component; the product listing for a specific category. *The category must be supplied in the URL or the route will not be matched.*

#### `/products/:category/:id`
corresponds to a route like `http://localhost:3000/products/sedan/12345` and the ProductDetail component; the product listing for a specific product. *The category and product ids must be supplied in the URL or the route will not be matched.*

#### `/order/1`
corresponds to `http://localhost:3000/order/1` and the Order/OrderStep1 component; screen 1 in the order flow.

#### `/order/2`
corresponds to `http://localhost:3000/order/2` and the Order/OrderStep2 component; screen 2 in the order flow.

#### `/order/summary`
corresponds to `http://localhost:3000/order/summary` and the Order/Summary component; the summary screen of the order flow.

#### `/order/thank-you`
corresponds to `http://localhost:3000/order/thank-you` and the Order/ThankYou component; the final submit screen of the order flow.

#### `/about`
corresponds to `http://localhost:3000/about` and the About component; the about page of the website.

#### `/contact`
corresponds to `http://localhost:3000/contact` and the Contact component; the contact page of the website.

#### `/404`
corresponds to `http://localhost:3000/404` and the NotFound component; the 404 page of the website.


### Layout
The website should be both responsive and adaptive; you must implement at least 2 breakpoints where the layout changes in some obvious fashion.

### 404 Not found
The website should display an attractive, usable and accessible 404 page when visiting a non-matched route.

### Navigation
The website must display 2 separate navigation menus on every page.

#### Navigation 1 links:
* Homepage
* Products
* About
* Contact

#### Navigation 2 links:
The product categories displayed by using the Categories component

Where you choose to place these 2 navigation menus is up to you, but they should reflect good principles of usability.

### Viewed Products
The website must display a list of the images of the 5 most recent products viewed on every page.

This component has already been implemented and is being imported in `App.js`. You shouldn't need to do anything with the logic, but it does need styling.

### Homepage
Your website must feature a homepage for **Vehiclr**. The name **Vehiclr** must appear on the homepage and in the title of every page of the website.

Your homepage (as well as the rest of the site) should use good principles of usability and accessibility discussed in class.

### About
Your website must feature an "About" page for **Vehiclr**.

Your about page should use good principles of usability and accessibility discussed in class.

### Contact
Your website must feature a "Contact" page for **Vehiclr**.

Your contact page should use good principles of usability and accessibility discussed in class.

### Order flow
Your order flow **must** have 3 screens/steps and collect user options and information as detailed below. The logic and routing to move from one screen to the next has already been implemented for you.

#### Options
When ordering, a user must specify values for options they want.

It is your responsibility as the UI developer to present the options in a clear and easy-to-understand manner, taking into account the option requirements as presented below and good principles of usability and accessibility.

##### Standard Options

All options can be found here:
`src/data/options.json`

Most options are standard and required. If a user does not select one of the required options, the UI should alert them to that fact when attempting to move on in the order flow.

Some non-required options have 2 parts:
* a selection option (do they want this option?) -- these options are named hasSomething (like hasRadio)
* a corresponding value option (how many or what type of this option do they want?)

Some options have error conditions already implemented. If the value is invalid, an error will be displayed and should be styled in such a way that it alerts the user to the fact that there is a problem.

Here is the list of options/information that you must gather in the order flow with explanations and how to store the information in state:

###### Color (required)
A user must select a hex/rgb color for their vehicle, with 2 exceptions:
* Taxis can only be yellow (#ffff0)

* Fire engines can only have 2 seats

**If the number is greater than 10 or less than 1, an error will be displayed.**

This logic is already implemented. On your seat number input, add the following handler
`onChange={setProductOption.bind(null, 'numSeats')}`

This logic is already implemented. On your tinted windows input, add the following handler
`onChange={setProductOption.bind(null, 'hasTintedWindows')}`

###### Radio
A user may select if they want a radio or not, with 1 exception:
* Fire engines cannot have radios.

**If the user tries to select a radio for a vehicle that can't have them, an error will be displayed.**

This logic is already implemented. On your seat number input, add the following handler
`onChange={setProductOption.bind(null, 'hasRadio')}`

If a user chooses to add a radio for a vehicle that can support it, they then need to choose the type of radio.

* Basic -- this option is only available for sedans and station wagons
* Medium -- this option is available for any vehicle that supports radios
* Fancy -- this option is only available for sports cars

The radio type options for the various categories can be seen in the `values` under `radioType` in `src/data/options.json`.

**These hood ornaments can be found in `values` under `hoodOrnament` in `src/data/options.json`. Each has a corresponding image that must be displayed along with the option.**

On your hood ornament type input, add the following handler
`onChange={setProductOption.bind(null, 'hoodOrnament')}`

###### Trunk monkey
A user may select if they want a trunk monkey or not.

On your trunk monkey input, add the following handler

On your monogram input, add the following handler
`onChange={setProductOption.bind(null, 'monogram')}`

#### Buyer information
During the order flow, you must collect following information about the buyer. Assume that the company will call them later to get payment information, so we do not have to gather credit card numbers insecurely, for example.

* Buyer’s name
* Buyer’s shipment address (street address, city, state, 5 digit zip code)
* Buyer’s billing address (street address, city, state, 5 digit zip code)
* Buyer’s phone number (10 digits - 3 digit area code + 7 digit number)
* Buyer’s cell number (10 digits - 3 digit area code + 7 digit number)
* Buyer’s date of birth (mm/dd/yyyy format)

All of this information is required. If a user does not fill in one of the required fields, the UI should alert them to that fact when attempting to move on in the order flow.

You may assume that all buyers live in the United States and all of their data can conform to formats used in the United States.

On every input you create for buyer information, add the following handler:
`onChange={setUserInfo.bind(null, [id to store info])}`.

So, for example, to store the buyer's name, you might use the handler:
`onChange={setUserInfo.bind(null, 'buyerName')}`

#### Summary page
The second-to-last step of the order flow must be a summary of all the gathered information presented in a clear, easy-to-read way.

#### Thank you page
The last step of the order flow must be a thank you page that thanks the user for their order.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Runs the install scripts to gather and install all dependent modules into node_modules

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
